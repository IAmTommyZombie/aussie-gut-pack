      "• Bacillus (subtilis, coagulans, clausii, indicus): Endospore-protected, survives gastric system and antibiotics, colonizes all gut areas, called 'next-generation probiotics'\n" +
      "• Lactobacillus (acidophilus, rhamnosus, reuteri, plantarum, casei, gasseri): Some strains survive gastric system, mainly colonize upper intestines\n" +
      "• Bifidobacterium (longum, infantis, bifidum, animalis, lactis): Doesn’t survive gastric system or antibiotics, functions in lower intestines; seek exopolysaccharide strains for dendritic cell communication\n" +
      "• Saccharomyces (boulardii, cerevisiae): Gram-positive yeast, survives antibiotics but not gastric system, aids antibiotic-associated diarrhea",
